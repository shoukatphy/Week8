## What is Neyman Construction?
This is a method to constuct an interval at a confidence level in such a way that it generates true valus within that interval for (many) repeated experiments. 
## How to Run the Programs?
I have been using [ C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170) and [ROOT](https://root.cern/install/) to develop these programs. In case you are missing the root in your system, you can install from here [https://root.cern/install/]. We can run these programs using [ROOT] *macro* as simply put these commands in your [ROOT] terminal type root[0] **`.x doDecays.C(10000)`** and type root[0] **`.x DecayAnalysis2.C(1000)`**
