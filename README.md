## How to Run the Programs?
I have been using [ C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170) and [ROOT](https://root.cern/install/) to develop these programs. In case you are missing the [ROOT](https://root.cern/install/) in your system, you can install. We can run these programs using [ROOT] *macro* by simply put these commands in your [ROOT](https://root.cern/install/) terminal. Pass an integer(```number of experiments```) as an argument of the function or type root[0] **`.x NuymanConst.C(20000)`** . So here we need to
